# Asking Questions

Many people tend to fall on one of two sides of "asking questions about almost everything" or "asking virtually no questions at all". Some people in modding communities become a little weary of people asking many questions and occasionally even looks down on asking questions at all. this isn't good blah blah balh.

### Asking Good Questions

There isn't really a template for asking good questions, but for wow modding there are some general pointers:

- Try to formulate your question completely in a single message.
- If you are following a tutorial, include this and what step you are currently on.
- If your problem consists of an error message, include this.
- If your problem involves feeling confused about a concept, program or guide, mention this.
- If your problem stems from a solution you came up with yourself, **briefly** explain what problem your own solution is meant to solve.

### Bad Question: Direct-messaging helpers

These are questions that you send to people who you may have seen helping other people out in support channels or that you have received help from yourself.

This is a bad way to ask questions, because someone helping you out with something or even many things don't make you friends. Very few helpers appreciate receiving unsolicited direct messages, and the amount of people doing this causes most people actively helping others in support channels to just disable their DMs entirely, making it more difficult for people to reach them for legitimate reasons.

### Bad Question: Asking to ask

These are questions on the form "is this the right forum to ask for xyz?"

Accidentally asking the wrong question in the wrong channel runs only a small risk of being 'wrong' if you read the channel description carefully, but 'asking to ask' **always** wastes everybodys time with an extra notification about nothing.

Nobody appreciates these questions, so don't ask them.

### Bad Question: Soliciting a "helper"

These are questions on the form "can someone help me with <vague problem description>?", or "anybody who is good at <general modding category>?".

This is a bad question, because those answering have no idea about the scope of your question or if they feel like taking the time to answer it. Most people with any experience in forums or messaging apps ignore these questions entirely.

### Bad Question: XY Problem

See [this article.](https://xyproblem.info/)

These are questions that ask about your own solutions rather than the problem you are trying to solve. In wow modding specifically, a similar problem often occurs when asking questions that follow a tutorial without mentioning that tutorial.

These are bad questions, because your own solution might be completely wrong, or the tutorial you are following might be severely outdated.

### Bad Question: Asking to skip work

These are questions on the form "how do i install trinitycore" when they ignore workflows that have clear tutorials for them already.

This is a bad question, because tutorials are there for a reason, and without explaining what about it you need help with or don't understand, most people will assume you're just trying to get someone else to do your own work for you.

Instead, be specific about what you don't understand or why you think the tutorial is too difficult or confusing. Some examples:

- I have tried installing trinitycore through the official tutorial, but I get this error "xyz" when I hit compile and I don't understand what it means.
    - _Why this is good: You clearly specify the step you are stuck on and described the specific problem you've encountered._

- I have tried installing trinitycore, but the tutorial is very overwhelming and I feel like i have no idea what i'm doing. So far I have done "xyz" but I don't know what I'm supposed to do next.
    - _Why this is good: You are honest about being confused about the process and include all the things you think you've done so far._

- I have tried to read the tutorial for installing trinitycore, but it feels like this is too difficult for me to do. Are there any easier tutorials or alternatives to just throw up a small test server for a complete beginner?
    - _Why this is good: You admit that setting up trinitycore itself might be too difficult for you, and you specify that your actual goal is to 'just have a playable server', which there might be alternatives for._

### Bad Question: Asking to avoid learning

Modding is difficult, workflows often take time to get into and frustrations can come at you at almost any time and in the most unpredictable forms.

Asking questions when stumbling into problems or even frustrations is not a bad thing on its own, but it's important to be wary of developing question-asking as a behavior to avoid doing your own research or experiments for anything that feels difficult or frustrating, because those are the only situations where you can effectively practice problem-solving yourself.

This has less to do with how many questions you ask, and more to do with how often you reach for asking without stopping to ask yourself if there is something you can try to teach yourself first, or an experiment you can attempt.

Aside from your very first steps into modding, if you frequently end up in situations where the only thing you can do is ask someone else, chances are you're attempting to do something that is too difficult for your current skill level, or that you are overwhelming yourself with too much frustration to learn anything effectively.

## Building Technical Proficiency

Even when narrowing down your modding scope to a single version of the game, like WoTLK, there are still tons of different file formats, conventions, programs and workflows to get used to.
