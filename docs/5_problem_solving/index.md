# Problem Solving

It is often said that programming and modding is a practice of "problem-solving", but it is rarely elaborated and effectively isn't saying much more than "just try harder".

Still, modding is unquestionably an often difficult process that tends to go wrong for a variety of reasons, and being able to handle such situations is what will separate a good modder from a decent one.

It is my belief that problem solving is not something reserved only for the "pros", but something you as a beginner can and should practice from your first day of modding, because it is one of the most important skills you can learn from it.

The purpose of this article is to attempt to formulate what I think problem solving is, what strategies I employ to solve problems in WoW modding and what you need to know to do that effectively.
