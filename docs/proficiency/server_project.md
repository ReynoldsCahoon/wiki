# Server Projects

So, you've spent the last couple of weeks or months just learning the ropes and all the kinds of cool things you can make this decade old game do, only now starting to realize just how much work has gone into making this all possible and all the endless possibilities for the kinds of crazy servers you could create.

But, then you might for a moment stop yourself. How come there aren't that many extensive custom servers around?

## The Truth about WoW Modding

The harsh truth about WoW modding is that the overwhelming majority of custom projects **fail** and never launch.

These aren't only projects started by modding novices, it has included some of the most technically proficient people in our scene who very well knew the tools at their disposal and how to structure projects using them.

With all the time and effort spent on getting our scene to where it as, how is this possible?

## Why Modding Projects is so hard

_Opinion warning_

I won't claim to actually know all the answers as to why so many custom projects fail and are abandoned. All I can do is offer my perspective on what I've seen spending the past 15 years around private server and emulator scenes, and the things I've seen commonly go wrong.

### Overambitious

This is probably one of the worst warnings I have to give, but this is the single most common issue that I see in almost every proposed custom project.

New and inexperienced developers who have just come to realize the possibilities that modding offers run the highest risk of falling to this, but even experienced developers do it as well.

It is very hard from the outset to understand how much work actually goes in to creating extensive customization for a game like WoW, and it's extremely hard for an inexperienced developer to know what _kinds_ of mods take so long to develop. A common example of this is the [_stat system_](https://gist.github.com/ihm-tswow/74e620b8918517ade7fccc31640ee0bc), which is so much more complicated to make consistent modifications than it would first appear that it's not even funny.

**Understand that there is a reason there isn't a myriad of custom expansions or completely custom stat systems created for the game, and that it's not because nobody tried before**

### Lonewolves

WoW modding is a type of hobby that tends to attract people who enjoy working alone. This isn't on its own a bad thing, plenty of lonewolves have created incredible tools and even servers for this game. However, extensive custom modifications are, even with the best of our tools, not realistic for a single developer to pull together in a couple of months or even a year.

If you want to create the server of your dreams, it's very likely that you will have to start to think about how to get other developers interested in your project if you want any chance of completing it. We will elaborate on this further down in this article.

**Be prepared to adapt your server idea into something that other people can reasonably help you out with.**

### Lack of discipline

Modding wow can be a fun and even relaxing hobby to do when keeping things small in scope, but to create an actual custom project for other people to play is a whole other beast.

Creating projects like this is real work, and much of it will not be very fun or rewarding to do short-term. Here, I've seen many projects fall into what's commonly called "feature-creep", where a developer will finish a feature only so far that it is actually interesting and enjoyable to work on, then drop it for something else once it becomes too frustrating or boring.

For some types of projects, this isn't actually a bad approach. One small project that's taken me almost 2 years to complete is a little tutorial island to introduce people to TSWoW. It's literally just a small island illustrating some code examples, but it also became sort of creative thing that I had a lot of fun putting together, and as soon as I got bored I took a 2 month break before resuming.

However, for a larger project this type of approach isn't realistic, and taking breaks from an ever expanding pile of features will eventually make them impossible to return to, because you'll stop to see the benefit of completing just one of them.

**Be mentally prepared that extensive custom projects are not as fun to implement as they are to theorize.**

### Too Theoretical

Many server ideas are sketched entirely inside a game designers head before a single line of code has been written, and quickly turns into a complex network of assumptions and reasoning with no basis in reality.

Basing your entire servers idea around a concept that you haven't even tried out a smaller prototype of is a recipe for a bunch of systems that aren't going to work out either in isolation or together.

Most ideas we humans get are stupid, and we need rigorous ways to rule out the few nuggets that are actually good. For designing video games, the only method we can reliably use is to playtest.

**Don't rely extensively on complicated systems that only exist in your own head without playtesting them in a simpler scenario**.
