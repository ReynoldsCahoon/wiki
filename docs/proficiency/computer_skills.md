# Computer Skills

Being able to navigate a computer effectively is an important foundation for anything to do with modding. You will be dealing with relatively complex directory hierarchies, edit a lot of text configuration files and have to manage and interface with crappy old GUI or command line programs may or may not do what they are supposed to.

If you are very new to using PCs, are mostly used to working with smartphones or tablets, or have mostly used PCs for gaming or browsing the web, your early struggles with modding will be related to figuring out these basic skills, and it's important to give yourself some time to do that, since many tutorials and guides will assumes those skills.

Remember that, most people who are highly proficient in modding today also had to start clicking random buttons on the screen and trying to figure out what the hell was going on at some point in their lives too.
