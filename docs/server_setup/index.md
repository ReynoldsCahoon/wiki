# Server Setup

Depending on what type of project you're planning to create, choosing a server core may be a difficult or a simple choice. This guide is split into two depending on what you need the server for.

- [**Short Version**](./core_short)
    - _For when you just want a server that's easy to set up to try out clientside mods._

- [**Longer Version**](./core_long)
    - _A longer discussion on the cores in common use among custom projects today._

- [**Misc**](./core_other)
    - _Lists of various other cores for very specific uses or versions other than WoTLK._
